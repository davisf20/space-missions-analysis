# Space Missions Analysis
SUPSI - Data Science - 2022/2023

Author: Davis Fusco

## Introduction
This project is part of the Datascience course of my studies as a computer engineer at SUPSI. The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset and then communicate the findings about it. The dataset that is used is the Space Missions Dataset, which is a record of all space missions since 1957. The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/agirlcoding/all-space-missions-from-1957).

## Description of the dataset
The dataset contains 4323 rows and 9 columns. The columns are the following:
- Company Name
- Location
- Datum
- Detail
- Status Rocket
- Rocket
- Status Mission

The analysis that I have done is the following:
- How many space missions have been launched per year?
- How much money has been spent on space missions per year?
- How much money has been spent on space missions per year per company?
- How many successful and failed space missions have been launched per year?
- How many space missions have been launched per company? Which company is more efficient?
- How much the cost influence the success of a space mission?
- How many space missions have been launched per country?

## Prerequisites
The following software are required to run the Jupyter Notebook:
- Python 3
- Anaconda
- Jupyter Notebook

The following libraries are used:
* numpy
* pandas
* plotly
  * plotly.express
  * plotly.graph_objects
  * plotly.subplots
* country_converter
