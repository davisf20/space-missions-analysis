# Space Missions Analysis
## Introduction
This project is part of the Datascience course of my studies as a computer engineer at SUPSI. The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset and then communicate the findings about it. The dataset that is used is the Space Missions Dataset, which is a record of all space missions since 1957. The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/agirlcoding/all-space-missions-from-1957).

## Prerequisites
The following software are required to run the Jupyter Notebook:
- Python 3
- Anaconda
- Jupyter Notebook

The following libraries are used:
* numpy
* pandas
* plotly
  * plotly.express
  * plotly.graph_objects
  * plotly.subplots
* country_converter

## File Descriptions
* `README.md`: This file.
* `requirements.txt`: The requirements file for reproducing the analysis environment.
* `Space_Missions_Analysis.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the analysis.
* `Space_Missions_Analysis.html`: The HTML version of the Jupyter notebook.
* `Space Missions - Presentation.pdf`: The presentation of the project.
* `Space_Corrected.csv`: The corrected dataset.

## Results
The complete analysis of the dataset can be found at the post available [here](https://davisf20.github.io/space-missions-analysis/).
